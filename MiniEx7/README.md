Instructions: Type a sentence into the input bar and see what happens (make sure to have your sound on).

Note: Sadly the program seems to have some issues in Firefox, so you're going to have to use Chrome.

1. What is the aesthetic aspects of our program in relationship to code and language?

Using the p5 Speech library we have made a program, using code, that to the user will appear as language (both spoken and written). The program also gives the user the ability to input some language of their own choosing (a sentence is recommended). The program will them manipulate that language iteratively until it becomes unrecognizable. It's intersting to see how an automatic process like this, executed by a computer that doesn't understand the language we input, can over time alter that input into  something completely different, than while probably nonsensical, is still in a language that we can understand (and the machine can't).
