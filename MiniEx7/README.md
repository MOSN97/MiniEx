Note: Sadly the program seems to have some issues in Firefox, so you're going to have to use Chrome.

Introduction: A sentence modulator. By the submission of a sentence chosen by the user, written into an input bar followed by the click of a "submit" button, executes an infinite loop of events. After submitting the sentence, the program splits up the sentence into single words that are then analyzed to find the part-of-speech (pos) tag for the given word (nn - noun, jj - adjective, vb - verb). A random word from the sentence is then chosen by the program to be replaced with a word with the same pos-tag. The words are put back together as the same sentence, but with one word swapped with a new one. The sentence is written on the screen in the form of text and the program starts reading it out loud. When the program is done talking, the whole process is once again being executed, but now the input sentence is the new one, generated by the program. So again a random word is chosen and changed depending on its pos-tag. This goes on forever, continually manipulating the sentence that drifts further and further from the original sentence, and becomes totally unrecognizable from it.
Once the loop has been executed by the click of the button, it can't be stopped, But the user can refresh the program by submitting a new sentence. This will clear the canvas and start transforming the new sentence scratch.

1. What is the aesthetic aspects of our program in relationship to code and language?

Using the p5 Speech library we have made a program, using code, that to the user will appear as language (both spoken and written). The program also gives the user the ability to input some language of their own choosing (a sentence is recommended). The program will them manipulate that language iteratively until it becomes unrecognizable. It's intersting to see how an automatic process like this, executed by a computer that doesn't understand the language we input, can over time alter that input into  something completely different, than while probably nonsensical, is still in a language that we can understand (and the machine can't).
