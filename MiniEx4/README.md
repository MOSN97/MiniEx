# MiniEx 4 - Brownie Clicker
https://rawgit.com/MOSN97/MiniEx/master/MiniEx4/empty-example/index.html

How to play: Click brownies to collect points. As you move your mouse around to collect brownies a trail of cookies will be created along the path your mouse moves. Touching these cookies or the outer walls of the canvas with the mouse will cause you to lose the game. Since the brownies appear randomly, luck is definitely a factor, but it's also a matter of trying not to trap yourself in a ring of cookies. See if you can beat my high score of 21000 (I can't).

1. What does my program capture?

My program captures the movement of the mouse and leaves a trail of cookies to show that it "remembers" were you've already been. The use of cookies for showing this trail is of course a sort of word play on web cookies, which is also small pieces of data that remembers previous actions.

2. How might this program help me understand the data capturing process in digital culture?

I'm not sure it does, really. I guess it shows how easy it is to capture data from the user like mouse movement and for a computer to store that data, but that doesn't really come as a suprise, at least not for me. Of course my program doesn't store the information permanently unlike Facebook or Google Analytics, but if you had enough space for stockpiling data like that over long periods of time (in the so-called cloud presumably, because if it's on the users computer it won't be of much use), you could very well keep track of a lot of people's actions on your site. Not that I know excatly how you'd go about doing that, but all the big companies seem to have figured it out though.
