1. Describe your first independent coding process

Well, I have some previous experience coding, so it wasn't really my first coding process, but it was my first time coding with p5.js or in JavaScript. Therefore it wasn't so much about figuring out how to code, as it was about figuring out how to code with p5.js. The reference part of the p5.js website was a huge help in this regard. It mostly became a process of wanting to do something, then checking out how you do it on the reference page, then writing the code and then trying it out. Then when I wanted to do something else, the process started over.

2. How is coding different or similar to reading or writing text?

Reading code is in someways similair to reading regular language I guess. What makes them different is mostly the languages themselves. Programming languages follow more strict rules than ordinary language and also uses some symbols we rarely see in regular text (curly brackets, backslashes and so on).

Writing code is very different from writing text in my opinion. Coding is about trying to get a computer to do a something through a series of commands and writing is about trying to express something to other people through words. You could say that text is made to be read by people, whereas in coding even if you're trying to make a program to be used by other people, in most cases it's still only computers that will read the code itself.

3. What is the potential of coding practice?

Well coding has a pretty huge potiential in theory. Everything computers can do, can be achieved through coding and that's a pretty long list of things. But what an individual can do with coding is a bit more limited. It mostly comes down to their expertise and how much time they spend on it.
