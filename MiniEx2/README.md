Note 1: There is more than one way to progress in The Game About Circles

Note 2: There will be audio played at some point during the program, but not immediately (and, don't worry,  it's not super loud or anything :-) )

1. Description of my program

The program is a small short "game" build up mainly of basic shapes and messages recieved through the web console. The reason i write game in quotation marks is that the program doesn't really have any gameplay in a tradition sense. All you can really do is click and then depending on what you click on, you'll get different responses in the web console and the game can progress in a few different ways.

2. What is fun?

I honestly feel like fun is a concept that's best not to try too hard to analyze or understand, because in some ways it serves to undermine it. I would much rather experience fun without being able to fully describe it, than know what the recipe for fun is. Still Goriunova gives several examples of what fun can be and I think my program falls into some of the those categories. "The fun of geekiness" is certainly one and I would also like to think there's a bit of humour in there. I personally think people are too quick to throw around the word "paradox", but there are definitely also things in the program, namely some of the comments you recieve through the web console and some of the tasks the program asks you to do, that seem absurd or contradictory.
